📈 Random Forest Regression – Salary Prediction

📖 Project Overview

This project demonstrates **Random Forest Regression** using Python and Scikit-Learn.

The goal is to predict salary based on **position level**.

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

The model uses:
- n_estimators = 10 (number of trees)
- random_state = 0 (for reproducibility)
